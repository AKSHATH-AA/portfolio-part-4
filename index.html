        <p id="shadowdescription">This cartoon character is called shadow the hedgehog. He is part of a series called sonic. Shadow is the villain. He can run immensly fast. He can also teleport. I like this character because he is like the flash. Shadow is a very serious and tough character. I really recommend watching the series sonic.</p>

        <p>Shadow The hedgehog is a very popular character because he is super fast and cool. I think that he is the perfect villain in the series and he provides just enough awesomeness. For more information about shadow got to the about section. He is serious (most of the time), cold, calculating, ruthless, and a tad egotistical. He will do anything to get what he wants, which makes him rather impulsive at times. He doesn't have much respect for Sonic or anyone else for that matter and often says things that hurt whoever he's talking to.</p>
